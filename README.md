Mutual Fund Investment Plan using Python
Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Python-based mutual fund investment planning system that helps investors design, analyze, and evaluate diversified portfolios. The solution uses historical market data to calculate returns, assess risk, simulate future outcomes, and recommend optimized portfolio allocations based on an investor’s risk profile.

The project demonstrates how data analytics, financial modeling, and simulation techniques can be combined to support informed investment decisions.

Objectives

Help investors build a diversified mutual fund portfolio

Analyze historical performance using financial metrics

Measure risk using volatility, Sharpe ratio, and downside analysis

Simulate future portfolio outcomes using Monte Carlo methods

Optimize asset allocation using mean-variance optimization

Generate an investment plan based on user risk preferences
